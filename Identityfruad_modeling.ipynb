    "This notebook uses a wide variety of modeling algorithms for a binary classification problem. It reads a file created from a feature selection process that has a reasonably small number of good variables, and we know their order of multivariate importance because we used a proper wrapper method. We can explore # input variables, model algorithms and tune model hyperparameters. At the end we can select our favorite algorithm, run it again and build the final model performace score percentile tables.\n",

    "Tested various algorithms with different parameter combinations, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Neural Network. To prevent overfitting, we employed 5-fold cross-validation during the selection process ,and calculated the average FDR at a 3% rejection rate to reduce the effect of randomness. The average FDR score was then used to compare the performance of different models. After comparing the results, LightGBM exhibited the highest FDR on the testing data and was selected as the final model.\n",
    "The LightGBM Classifier with parameters: max_depth=6, n_estimators=1000, num_leaves=10, and learning_rate=0.05, was the best and final model. The FDR scores for this model on training, testing, and OOT data were 53.00%, 52.80%, and 50.07%, respectively. (Taking number of variables =20)\n",
